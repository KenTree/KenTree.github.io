### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    For Lab 5, Part 1 and Part 2 were great labs due to the first part being able to build code that makes use of input validation, and prints out a sandwich that you have constructed with the correct inputs of ingredients. Utilizing command line argument statements was a great and intriguing lesson.  Part 2 was a great lab as well because we had to build on that input validation. Being able to work on Boolean functions in order to implement the calculation of score given two cards for Blackjack was a fun and difficult challenge.

* Lab 7 

    For Lab 7, Part 1 was a fun lab due to making use of if statements as well as while loops in order to decrease the amount of guesses made on a secret number. It was challenging because when I compiled and ran the lab I would run into some problems I would need to fix such as infinite loops in the beginning, and then the game not finishing after the secret number was guessed. I believe this lab really lets you take on the if statements within while loops and allows you to learn a lot from it.  

* Lab 9

    For Lab 9, Part 1 was challenging lab at first because of it being the introduction to writing code that reads from a file as well as writing to a file and handling I/O errors. My partner and I were working great together and we were able to figure out the lab before the end of the class. We learned new code such as std::ifstream, and making use of if statements if the file was not good. This lab really challenged us to use vectors and the .push_back command in order to have our program work correctly. In this case our program took a .txt file and looked for words specific in size and pushed them to print only resulting in the specified words.
